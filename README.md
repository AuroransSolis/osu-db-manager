# osu-db-manager
Project goal: to provide a useful tool to browse the three main osu! database types, as well as merge and manage scores
and collections databases.

### Milestones:
Here's a non-comprehensive list of smaller goals I'm working to achieve as part of completing the project:
- ~~loading databases singlethreaded~~ (COMPLETE)
- ~~loading databases multithreaded~~ (COMPLETE)
- querying databases (WIP)
- ~~parsing arguments~~ (COMPLETE)
- merging scores/collection databases
- interactive browsers
- writing databases to file

### Contributing
Anyone is more than welcome to contribute! If you've cloned my repo and tested it with your own databases and found an
issue, open one and let me know what went wrong! If you think you've got a better way of doing something I've done 
(let's face it, it's probably a better way) or another way of going about the task entirely, open a PR and I'll review
it as soon as I get the chance! I'm so thankful for your interest in my silly little pet project.
